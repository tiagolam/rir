# RTP In Rust

An implementation of the RTP protocol using the Rust language.

## Overview

State: PoC

The implementation has been based around RFC 3550. Implementation of some of the extensions (at least the most important ones) are planned, but only once this work is stable and the overall architecture of the library is defined.

## Architecture

Since this is still just a PoC, and there's a lot of Rust learning going on at the moment, the architecture is still being defined.
